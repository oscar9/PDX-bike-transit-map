##PDX Bike to Transit Map :bike: :bus: :globe_with_meridians:

====================

This handy map can display bike routes, transit stops, and transit routes at the same time, so you can find your own way to bike to transit stops. This was built with MapBox, TileMill, CartoDB, and Leaflet (with the Leaflet Vector Layers plugin), and OpenStreetMap and TriMet data. Zoom in to see transit stops, and click on them for more information and links to the TriMet TransitTracker for that stop.

This is v3 of a project I started a couple of years ago. The original version was awarded "Most Original App" in the second round of Portland's CivicApps contest.

If you like this, you might also like another project I worked on, TriMet's new multimodal Map Trip Planner at [http://ride.trimet.org], which can plan biking and bike-to-transit trips. Visit my website, [http://pdxmele.com], for more maps and projects.

Sources: OpenStreetMap contributors (bike routes from May 4, 2013, basemap styled by MapBox), transit data from TriMet on May 27th, 2013. Transit updates for service changes are provided as new data becomes available.
